        <p>My research interests lie in geospatial information technology and its applications in hazards and transportation. Within the broader field of geographical information science, my primary focus is on transportation and disaster management. My PhD dissertation centers on the development of wildfire evacuation models for wildland-urban interface (WUI) communities. Specifically, I am working on a staged wildfire evacuation model designed for transient populations, with the goal of reducing evacuation time estimates and improving the management of evacuation traffic, particularly in areas closer to the advancing fire front. Through the integration of traffic simulation and fire spread models, my research aims to provide communities with data-driven tools and resources to effectively manage wildfire events, thereby minimizing the loss of life and property.</p>
